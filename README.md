A dashboard of bike sharing data using Tableau



## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to help build a case that a bike-sharing program may be successful in Des Moines. Using Tableau Public and a real Citibike dataset we'll look into the average length of trips, number of bike trips by hour and gender, and by days of the week. All of this information will be integrated into an interactive dashboard linked to below. By looking at this data, investors will have a better idea of what kind of business they can expect and how to structure the most successful business model possible.

## Results:

## Summary:

Based on the data we can conclude a few things. For one, bikes tend to stay in the areas they come from, at least generally. Secondly, most rides take as little as 5-6 minutes, with relatively few exceptions beyond 50 minutes or so. Thirdly, most rides tend to take place around the morning and evening rush hours of 8-9 a.m. and 5-6 p.m. This suggests that people are using the bikes as a way of getting to work, and most likely make the trip back home on the bikes as well. We also see that most users use the bikes during the weekdays, not the weekends, which further suggests that the bikes are used as an alternative to mass transit or walking to get to work or other weekday responsibilities (ex. students going to class). This is not quite the case among non subscriber users, who tend to use the bikes mostly on Saturdays.

After this information is established we look into gender dynamics to see if there are any major differences or similarities between them. What we find is that there is little difference between genders other than the total number of users, which is must greater for men. When looking at every other metric analyzed here, we see basically no difference in usage distribution. Like men women tend to use the bikes during the weekdays if they are subscribers, but more often on weekends when they are not.

An additional visualization that could help investors gain insight would be showing if bikes tend to be brought back to where they were picked up. This could help show how often bikes need to be moved by the company to supply low bike areas. A second visualization that could help would be displaying trends for bikes that have larger numbers of repairs then other bikes. Perhaps if we knew the circumstances behind why these bikes are repaired more than others investors could determine ways to lower maintenance costs by avoiding these situations or preparing for them appropriately.
